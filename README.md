# IPASC WG4: Photoacoustic Data #

This working group aims to understand the format of the raw, reconstructed and accompanying metadata available from commercial and home-built photoacoustic imaging instruments available according to WG3. While WG3 gather information, WG4 can focus near term on commercial imaging instruments and identifying the metadata that would be required to enable open access and use of data arising from the phantom measurements.
